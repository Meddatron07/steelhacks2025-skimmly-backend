# Backend Deployment Options

Your frontend is successfully deployed to S3! Now you need to deploy your backend. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Use ngrok (Quickest for testing)

1. **Install ngrok**:
   - Download from: https://ngrok.com/download
   - Extract and place ngrok.exe in your PATH

2. **Expose your local backend**:
   ```bash
   # Your backend is already running on port 5000
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

3. **Get your public URL**:
   - ngrok will give you a URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
   - This URL is public and accessible to anyone

## Option 2: Deploy to Heroku (Free alternative to AWS)

1. **Install Heroku CLI**: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

2. **Create Procfile**:
   ```
   web: gunicorn app:app
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy backend"
   git push heroku main
   ```

## Option 3: Manual EC2 Setup

1. **Launch EC2 instance** (t3.micro - free tier)
2. **Upload your files** using SCP or WinSCP
3. **Install dependencies** and run your app

## Option 4: Use your current local setup temporarily

Since your backend is working locally, you can:
1. Keep it running on your computer
2. Use port forwarding or VPN to make it accessible
3. Update frontend to use your public IP + port 5000

## Recommended: Try Option 1 (ngrok) first

It's the fastest way to get a public URL for your backend without complex AWS setup.

## After deployment:

1. Get your backend URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
2. Update your frontend JavaScript files
3. Replace `localhost:5000` with your new backend URL
4. Re-upload frontend to S3

Your website will then be fully functional and accessible to anyone!
